## Documentation for Pyr0-Piezo Z-Probe Sensors

Pyr0-Piezo is a circuit design that incorporates the use of Piezoelectric Elements in order to reliably sense the real-world location of a 3D printer's bed. It incorporates a microcontroller (MCU) to sense the specific conditions of a printer that could effect the sensor's input, and make on-the-fly adjustments to ensure a consistent reading.
